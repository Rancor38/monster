# Project Proposal

## Project Description

I plan on making an application that allows the user to look over a list of monsters from Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition. I am going to pull the data from the Open5e API. The homepage will display a list of monsters pulled from the API (displayed as cards if I can get the styling right, or as names if I cannot), and clicking on the monster 'card' should reveal the monster's stat-block, also pulled from the API.

### MVP User Stories

- _As a user, I want to see a listing of all of the monsters in 5th edition, so I can decide which ones I want to use in my game._
- _As a user, I want to be able to click on a monster and see its stat block so I can use it in my game._
- _As a user, I want to be able to use this on a phone, tablet, or computer so that I can use the information at my table._

### Stretch Goals
- _As a user, I'd like to be able to filter my results so that I can search for the monsters that I more easily, by name, creature type, or challenge rating._
